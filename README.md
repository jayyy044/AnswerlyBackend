# Answerly

**AI-Powered Job Application Assistant**

Answerly is an intelligent job application response generator that transforms your resume and LinkedIn profile into a searchable knowledge base, enabling you to generate tailored, contextual responses to open-ended job application questions in under 10 seconds.

## Overview

Job applications often require thoughtful responses to open-ended questions like "Why do you want to work here?" or "What interests you about this role?" Answerly automates this process by:

1. **Processing your professional history** - Extracts and structures your resume and LinkedIn data into semantic chunks
2. **Understanding the context** - Analyzes job descriptions and determines if company research is needed
3. **Finding relevant experiences** - Searches your profile using advanced semantic retrieval (MMR search)
4. **Generating tailored responses** - Creates natural, conversational 60-75 word answers that connect your background to the specific role
